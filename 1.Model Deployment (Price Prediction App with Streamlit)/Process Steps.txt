1. Create a folder on Desktop named "streamlit" and create a file named "my_app.py" inside it.

2. Create virtual environment

   python -m venv env_name (python3 but not python in ec2)

3. activate venv 

   source env_name/Scripts/activate  
   (if not works try without source)  
   (in linux/mac machines "bin" instead of Scripts: see below) 
   source env_name/bin/activate 
   (python.exe -m pip install --upgrade pip) if required
   (just "deactivate" to deactivate the venv)


   (if you want to create conda env: see below)
   conda create -n env_name 
   conda env list
   activate env_name
   

4. add packages into venv

   pip install streamlit
   pip install sklearn

or 

"""pip install -r requirements.txt        
   (if you already have requirement file)""""

"""(pip list) to see the packages
   (pip freeze > requirements.txt) to create requirement file""""
   
   
  (python -V)
  (streamlit version)

5. streamlit run my_app.py
